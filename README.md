# Simple-Weather-App

## Description
This is a web application that allows users to search for cities and view current and forecasted weather information. When a city is searched, users receive information about the current weather, including the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed, along with a 5-day forecast showing the same. The application also includes a search history feature, storing previous searches using localStorage to show search history across sessions.
